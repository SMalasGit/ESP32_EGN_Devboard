This is a custom PCB for an ESP32 robot, meant to act as an educational tool for students and engineers alike. This PCB is built on 6 layers, features an ENIG finish, and uses Via-in-pad technology for compact size and function

This custom pcb has several unique features and can be combined with standard Arduino code libaries or off the shelf Epressif IDF IDE code to create a custom rover, robot, etc. This pcb features a custom lithium ion power path IC, allowing for power via USB-C, lithium ion battery, or both, depending on which power source is available. This IC also features battery protection and charging, allowing a user to know when the battery needs charging from the orange LED indicator, and when it is done charging from the green LED indicator

Furthermore, this pcb features a buck-boost regulator to allow a constant steady supply of 5 volts. In addition, this PCB includes a mosfet-based motor driver IC to control DC motors with ease. Since this board utilizes the powerful ESP32-S3 with a 240MHZ processor that includes Wifi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee, I have included a parallel camera interface connector, along with an SDIO microSD card connector. Finally, there is a series of GPIOs broken out for additional functionality, with UART and I2C capability.
